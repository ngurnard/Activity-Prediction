# Activity-Prediction
Smart devices held by billions of people all over the world contain hardware 
that is capable of mass data collection such as acceleration sensors, cameras, 
and fingerprint sensors. In this project, the problem of human activity 
prediction is outlined and analyzed. Using only simple features extracted from
the time series data of smartphone/smartwatch accelerometers and gyroscopes, a 
classification model was made to identify what the subject was physically doing,
such as walking, typing, eating, etc. Then, the variable that matters most when 
attempting to create a predictive model is identified. This project is noteworthy 
because it has the potential to save thousands of lives in the medical field or 
help fitness instructors monitor the progress of their clientele. 

The "main.R" script containts the majority of code used in this project.
The "tables.R" script contains the code used to make tables.
The "graph_maker.R" script contains the code that creates graph of acceleration 
reading over time for each user, each activity, and each device.
  
The data from this project comes from the WISDM smartphone and smartwatch activity 
and biometrics dataset found in the UCI Machine Learing Repository.
